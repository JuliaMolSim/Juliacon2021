# AbstractAtomicPotentials.jl

(also perhaps a terrible name) interface for interatomic potentials and force fields (AbstractForces.jl / AbstractPotential.jl / name?)

* getting energies and forces from underlying force field
* maybe taking inspiration/making sure it is compatible with existing force field sharing methods: [OpenKIM](https://openkim.org/), [OpenFF](https://openforcefield.org/), [MMSchema](https://molssi.github.io/mmschema/)
